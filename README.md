 ## LED Blink Revisited
Included Files: 

Description:In this assignment I had to wire up and LED and use an analog output instead of digital write to get the LED to fade. 

Lessons Learned: In this lesson I struggled with how to make the variable start counting down when you reached the maximum (255). I got help from another student who showed me that you can use an if statement so that when you reach the maximum the variable changes so you start counting down.
